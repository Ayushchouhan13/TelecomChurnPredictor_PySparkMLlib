# TelecomChurnPredictor_PySparkMLlib
Welcome to the Telecom Churn Prediction project! This project leverages PySpark's MLlib library to predict churn in telecommunication data. The churn prediction model developed here has achieved an impressive result with an approximate churn rate of 5%.

**Project Overview**

Telecom companies face significant challenges in retaining customers, making churn prediction a critical task. This project addresses this challenge by building a predictive model using PySpark's MLlib. The model analyzes customer demographics, usage patterns, and other relevant features to predict which customers are likely to churn.

**Key Features**

-> Uses PySpark's MLlib for scalable and distributed machine learning.

-> Predicts churn with high accuracy, achieving a 5% churn rate.

-> Scalable and efficient, suitable for large telecommunication datasets.

-> Provides insights into customer behavior and factors influencing churn.

**Why Use This Project?**

-> Improve customer retention strategies by identifying at-risk customers early.

-> Optimize marketing efforts by targeting specific customer segments.

-> Gain valuable insights into factors driving churn in the telecommunication industry.

-> Leverage the power of PySpark for scalable and parallelized machine learning.

**Getting Started**

-> Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

-> Prepare your telecommunication dataset with relevant features.

-> Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the churn prediction model.

-> Evaluate the model's performance and use it to predict churn for new data.

**Contributing**

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether it's bug fixes, feature enhancements, or documentation improvements, your contributions are valuable.
